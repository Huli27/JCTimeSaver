Thank you for looking at my compiler!

This compiler will compile all .java files in the current directory. You may also compile specific files by entering them as an argument on the command line. 

To ensure that the compiler then runs the proper tester file, please make sure to change the static String from DEFAULT to the name of your current tester file. If you have any comments or questions please feel free to contact me :) Thank you!!
